		<p class="description" data-aos="slide-left">
				Created my personal website from scratch using front-end development tools such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, coded on Sublime Text. The original website used to be a pure bootstrap theme website, but since this was too cliché, I've decided to make one from scratch to customize the website to my own taste. It was also a great opportunity to get a hands-on web development. This site uses custom css files, and transitions for more pleasurable view for users. </p>

		<div class="right">
		<p class="description" data-aos="slide-left">
				This project involves a ball on a plate, a camera to achieve bird-view of the plate, and two servo motoros to control the x and y directions of the ball. I'm using OpenCV to retrieve the x and y positions of the ball, and this information is sent to Arduino in which then two PID loops are used to calculate the error difference. Then, this calculation is sent to the two servo motors to tilt the plate so the ball is always balanced. </p>

				This project was derived from the course I took on my own called "Embedded Systems Course" offered by edX. It involves using a TM4C123 LaunchPad to create the "Space Invaders" game controller by manipulating electronic components such as switches, LED, and the slide pot. I used 2D arrays for game images on a LCD Screen while using DAC concepts for audio.</p>

				Final first-year group project at the University of Waterloo. The objective of the robot is to detect different coloured balls and sort them by dispensing them into the corresponding bins. Our group used motion sensors, colour sensor, as well as two servo motors to create this robot. The sensor feedback created from the sensors were integrated to map the rotation of the robot as well to adjust the locations of the bins correspondingly, programmed in Robot C.

				A car powered by hydrogen fuel-cells. This was a school project that combines three of the core courses, Digital Computation, Chemistry, and Mechatronics Engineering, collaborated with two other cohorts. This car was programmed on a TI LaunchPad, and has a line-following algorithm that allows the car to follow the black line in a maze. This project involved lots of trial and error because the maze had various types of barriers the car needed to avoid using integrated sensors.

				This project was done for my Computer Engineering class in Grade 12. The goal of the project was to design, and come up with an algorithm that drives the stepper motor driver using gates and flip-flops. This was my first exposure to electornics, as I built the algorithm from scratch with the use of different components on the breadboard. I've learned how to design/read schematics diagrams using National Instruments Multisim, and learned basic functionality of electronics.

		<p class="description" data-aos="slide-left">
				This project is a user-friendly calender application built using Object-Oriented Programming techniques in Java that allows personal log-in credentials via data encryption with a real-time built-in reminder function accomplished by multithreading. Each users are able to create events by a to-do-list addon on the calendar. This was approached via LinkedLists and Inheritance. 

				The calendar itself was designed using hitboxes of 2D arrays, and the calendar data, such as Years, Months, were approached via Inheritance, LinkedLists, and manipulation of text files.

				The PushBox was my final project for Grade 11 Computer Science. This project was completed in two months, and it is essentially a remake of a famous online classic game, "PushBox". The project was redesigned, and completed on Java, using Ready to Program IDE. 

				This project is graphics based, and all the maps were made with 2D arrays with hitboxes. The maps were dividing into square tiles, and each tiles represented different elements of the map.

				This was my very second Java game that I created for my Grade 11 Computer Science course (ICS3U). This game is a remake of a famous game from a TV show "The Price is Right", redesigned by myself. The game involves user input and interaction, where the player is shown an incorrect price and is given a chance to correctly deicde whether each digit in the correct price is higher or lower than the one shown. If they get all four digits right, they win a prize.

				This game is a remake of a famous game from a tv show "The Price is Right", redesigned by myself. The player is shown the first digit in the price of a car on a game board with eight screens, and is presented with four oversized dice on a gaming table. The contestant rolls the first die; if the number rolled matches the second digit, the digit is revealed and shown on both screens. Otherwise, the contestant must decide whether the digit is higher or lower than the roll and his or her selection is marked with an outline of lights. If the player gets all guesses right for the digits, they win a prize.

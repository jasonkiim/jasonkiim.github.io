                                  <!-- DESCRIPTION-->
                               Traditional gear systems such as planetary gears often have high backlash and therefore are not ideal for high precision movements. Correcting backlash for these systems can often be expensive and mechanically challenging, in order to solve this I began development on a high torque, low cost, and lightweight solution for a robotic joint, the 3D printed harmonic drive.
                               <br> <br>
                               The strain wave gearing theory is a special type of mechanical gear system that can improve certain characteristics compared to traditional gearing systems. This gearing system is based on the elastic dynamics and modulus of flexibility of the material. The mechanism has three basic components, a flexible spline, a wave generator, and a circular spline.
                               <br> <br>
                              The wave generator component is made of two parts: an outer ball bearing and an elliptical disk (a wave generator plug). The wave generator gear plug is inserted into the bearing, as a result giving the bearing an elliptical shape.
                               <br> <br>
                              The second part of this mechanism is a flexible spline which looks like a shallow cup. The outside of the spline is very thin, but the bottom is thick and stiff. As a result the walls are significantly more flexibility. The teeth are positioned radially around the outside of the flexible spline allowing for evenly engagement of the teeth. The flex spline fits tightly over the wave generator, so that when the wave generator plug is rotated, the flex spline deforms to the shape of a rotating ellipse but does not rotate with the wave generator.
                              <br> <br>
                              The final active component is the circular spline. This is a rigid circular ring with teeth on the inside. The flex spline and wave generator are placed inside the circular spline, meshing the teeth of the flex spline and the circular spline. Because the flex spline has an elliptical shape, its teeth only actually mesh with the teeth of the circular spline in two regions on opposite sides of the flex spline, along the major axis of the ellipse.
                              <br> <br>
                              Given that the wave generator is the input rotation the wave generator plug rotates, the flex spline teeth which are meshed with those of the circular spline change. The major axis of the flex spline will rotate with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point at the same rate as the wave generator. The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (for example three fewer) on the flex spline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the flex spline would be required to rotate a slight amount (three teeth) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flex spline in the opposite direction.

                             I've had a growing interest in biomechanical applications of Mechatronics since I stared my undergrad career. This project is a summative I've been researching and developing since the end of my first semester. I began by learning basic human anatomy and consulting peers who are coming close to graduating from the Ergonomics program here at Waterloo. The current scope of this project is to have a prototype completed by the end of December 2015 that can actuate an index finger. 
                            <br> <br>
                            When completed the outcome will be a mechanical exo-member that can be used to actuate parts of the human body that are afflicted by injuries. Using embedded probes and a closed feedback loop I can processes said data with regression algorithms and actuate the joints (such as the ones shown in my demo video) to replicate muscular movements. This allows movement of injured limbs by taking the load off said limbs. 
                            <br> <br>
                            I’m currently compiling the technical report and will be releasing it with the completion of my project, this is my first technical report.

                             I developed this reduction ratio drive for the end effector on the UW Mars Rover. There were issues with the strength of the grip and the lack of a mechanical stop, without which the object being gripped would slip and fall. Several alternatives such as worm gear and window motor were considered; however, each of these had their own issues, whether it was price or weight. The final design was a planetary gear with a high reduction ratio.

                              Hack the North was an amazing event; incredible people, incredible projects, and incredibly inspiring! When the team and I initially got together to start the hack we spent about two hours trying to figure out what we were going to do; until I remembered a presentation I had seen at work several days before. I remembered watching my manager present the new robotic arm link solid model that was going to be used to automate the drive axle assembly… with a mouse and trackpad in hand. It’s such an impressive and cool thing to be able to design robots, but this presentation wasn’t getting this across at all. That’s where the MYO interface came in.
                              <br> <br>
                              The team and I spent over 30 hours over the weekend developing the controller interfacing and making it as refined as possible. In the end we had a project we were all proud of. It wasn’t super complicated in the gestures that it could do but we’d come up with something new; something each one of us is definitely going to use next time we made a presentation with a solid model.

                               Posture and the way you walk is important. Very slight variations in walking posture times thousands of steps a day can mean extra stress on various part of your foot, leg, and even the rest of your body. Thus, our target user is anyone interested in analyzing their own walking behavior. Some people may be walking wrong their whole lives without even knowing it.
                                <br> <br>
                                Our app, Footsies, is currently on the Android platform. Even though Sensoria has developed a suite of frameworks for the smart sock, there has not been any major framework for Android. Thus, the technical difficulty was difficult as we needed to store/interpret all of the data, and manually look at all of the accelerometer data/pressure data and calibrate the app so that we can accurately determine what is a step, and also manually make a visual map of the pressures on the feet in real time. It connects to the Sensoria smart sock via Bluetooth, and allows the user to get a variety of information from the device. Through research I found that the raw data given by the pressure sensor is not what is truly need for gait analysis so in order to parse and use this data raw algorithms were developed to convert this data into force-reaction data. 
                                <br> <br>
                                It calibrates to each users' step pressures through a short and easy process, allowing the app to get more a more meaningful measurement. The app has three main modes: diagnosis, monitor, and training. In diagnosis mode, the user is asked to take 10 normal steps, and based on those steps the app attempts to make a diagnosis based on the gait pressures measured. Even if no meaningful conclusion is reached, the app graphs the data to which may help to find correlations. In monitor mode, the user can watch the details of their every step. A "heat" map of pressure is shown, which can show if a user has a habit of leaning in- or out-wards, for example. In training mode, the user can decide on a number of steps as a goal, and the app will count them to that goal while alerting them of any bad posture steps they made along the way. Footsies even has Pebble integration; the smartwatch will alert you via vibrations if you make a bad step.

                            <p>
                               The servo mechanical arm is a project I thought of during my first co-op term. I wasn’t feeling challenged by my job; I didn’t feel like I needed to or had the opportunity to learn anything. So every day after finishing all the work my manager had for me I would sit down and conceptualize different ideas for this arm.
                                <br> <br>
                                All the rotation was controlled through independent servos relayed back to Arduino Uno. However, now the arm is now controlled using ROSSERIAL through a PIC16F628A microcontroller. The prototype frame was entirely 3D printed.
                                <br> <br>
                                Right now I’m modifying the arm to help me with precision soldering for PCB builds. I have big hands and sometimes holding a soldiering iron centimeters away from my finger isn’t “comfortable”. The arm’s controlled via an Xbox controller using the ROS driver "joy". The analog stick (coarse movement) and directional pad (fine movement) are the axis controls. This’ll leave one hand free to help align components and lead to much cleaner PCBs, and uncharred fingertips.

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Hydrogen Fuel Cell Powered Toy Car</p>

                            <p>
                               The goal of the fuel cell car project was to build a car and use a hydrogen fuel cell to power the motor driver. As an added challenge the car with the best run time and fuel economy got the highest mark. The average run time for the car within the class was just under six and a half minutes; I managed to get my car ran for just over nineteen minutes. 
                              <br> <br>
                              That large difference in runtime wasn’t just luck (I hope); I‘d spent a lot of time researching pressure vessels and gas transfer to understand how to optimize fuel economy. During week one of the project I began by drafting several solid models of the cars body and gas containment vessels. I’d built and machined several prototypes and tested them all for transfer efficiency percentage. Once the physical design was confirmed I began preforming chemical calculations to determine how much hydrogen fuel was being created by the electrolysis reaction. Once the stoichiometric and reaction calculations were completed and confirmed, I began designing the PCB controller that would allow me to remotely control the car.
                               <br> <br>
                              The controller used was a PS3 controller relayed to an Arduino Uno via a Bluetooth dongle. The servo motor was used to turn a 360 degree lateral platform with two wheels to a stepping angle of 5 degrees. Once the car was finished it was able to navigate several tightly made mazes with considerable speed and accuracy. It was really great being able to integrate something I’d learned outside of class into a project in class. I see a lot of cool things on the way.

                              The firefighter was the first project I’ve ever done that required an ADC (analog digital converter), an independent motor controller, an IR relay module all together at the same time. The robot was designed to be able to navigate a maze with four rooms and four halls and ultimately detect a candle and blow it out; all with the shortest run time.
                              <br> <br>
                              This project was very open ended as the only thing that was required was that you navigated to all four rooms and managed to blow out the candle. Typically this project is assigned to groups of two or more people given the timeline but I decided I’d like to try it on my own. I love working on teams but this project required a lot of research to complete and I wanted to work on each and every part of it.
                              <br> <br>
                              When I started this project I was going in blind. From day one I was in the lab early trying to understand every detail about how to actuate, program and troubleshoot this project. It resulted in creative solutions to problems such as boot-loader programming. When programming PIC chips they often get fried due to static electricity; however with a bootloader solution you can program the PIC chip through a composite cable and terminal.
                              <br> <br>
                              A thorough understanding of the project and technologies also allowed me to optimize schematic designs for cost of production and real-estate on my robot. In addition to everything I’ve mentioned till now I also learned programing logic gate relays, microcontroller interfacing, the internals of a PIC chip, basic actuation theory, signal filtering from analog sensors using analog to digital signal conversion, and even basic machining skills. 
                              <br> <br>
                              I definitely had doubts some days about if I was going to finish but that was really just another motivator. It paid off in more ways than one; I learned a lot from this project. As a final note, I think this is when I became sure that robotics was my passion.

                              The robots were placed inside a black ring with a white pinstripe surrounding it. Both robots were placed parallel to each other facing in opposite directions. They were then simultaneously turned on. <br> <br>
                              From here the robots would begin spinning until their infrared sensors picked up the signal bouncing off of the opposing robot. The bot would then proceed to push the opposing robot out of the ring. If the bot got to the edge of the ring a system similar to the line follower robot would detect the line and steer the bot back to safety.

                             This project was done for my Computer Engineering class in Grade 12. The goal of the project was to design, and come up with an algorithm that moves the stepper motor driver using gates and flip-flops. This was my first exposure to electornics, as I built the algorithm from scratch with the use of different components on the breadboard. I've learned how to design/read schematics diagrams using Multisim(?), and learned basic functionality of electronics.

                                The goal of the hydrogen fuel-cell car was to build a car powered by hydrogen fuel-cells. The additional factor to this project was to create a line-following algorithm, so that the fastest team that completed the line-mze tracks got the highest mark. 
                                <br><br>
                                This project was a mix of three core courses, CHE102 (Chemistry), MTE100 (Mechatronics Engineering), GENE121 (C++). Our team had to research the pressure vessels associated with each fuel-cell, as well as the gas transfer to maximize the run-time. Once the research was done, we performed various chemical calculations to determine how much hydrogen fuel was created. As for the programming, we were given a designated IDE to successfully code the line-following algorithm. Bascially, the algorithm would allow the robot to follow the line-maze around the tracks and get to the endpoints without interffering with the obstacles.
                                <br><br>
                                This was my very first group project with my cohorts, and it was really interesting how I was able to integrate core courses to build a robot that runs on hydrogen-cells and navigate itself on line-maze.

                                The Digital Colour-Based Sorter was the final group project for my 1A term, in which the objective of the robot was to detect different coloured balls and sort them into corresponding bins. We used motion sensors, colour sensors, as well as two servo motors to create the robot.
